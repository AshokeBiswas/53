Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient for study time vs exam scores
Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose the data collected is as follows:

Student	Study Time (hours)	Exam Score (%)
1	4	85
2	3	78
3	5	90
4	6	92
5	2	70
To calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (

​
 
∑(x

After calculation, if 
𝑟
=
0.95
r=0.95, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship between study time and exam scores, suggesting that as study time increases, exam scores tend to increase as well.

Q2. Spearman's rank correlation for sleep vs job satisfaction
Spearman's rank correlation assesses the monotonic relationship between two variables, which means it measures how well the relationship between variables can be described using a monotonic function. Suppose the data collected is:

Person	Sleep (hours)	Job Satisfaction
1	7	8
2	6	7
3	8	9
4	5	5
5	6	6
To calculate Spearman's rank correlation:

Rank the data for each variable.

Calculate the difference in ranks for each pair.

Compute Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (
𝜌
ρ):

𝜌

∑

ρ=1− 
n(n

6∑d

​
 
​
 

where 
𝑑
𝑖
d 
i
​
  is the difference in ranks for each pair.

If 
𝜌
=
0.85
ρ=0.85, it indicates a strong monotonic relationship between sleep hours and job satisfaction, suggesting that as sleep hours increase, job satisfaction tends to increase as well, or vice versa.

Q3. Pearson correlation vs Spearman's rank correlation for exercise hours vs BMI
Given data for 50 participants:

Participant	Exercise Hours	BMI
1	3	25
2	5	28
...	...	...
Pearson correlation would be appropriate if you assume a linear relationship between exercise hours and BMI.
Spearman's rank correlation would be suitable if you believe there's a monotonic relationship (directionally consistent but not necessarily linear).
Compare results to understand the nature of the relationship observed in the data.

Q4. Pearson correlation coefficient for TV watching vs physical activity
Given data for 50 participants:

Participant	TV Hours	Physical Activity (hours)
1	3	2
2	5	1
...	...	...
Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the linear relationship between TV watching and physical activity hours.

Q5. Relationship between age and soft drink preference
To analyze the relationship, a survey's results might show:

Age Group	Prefer Brand A (%)	Prefer Brand B (%)	Prefer Brand C (%)
20-30	30	40	30
31-40	25	35	40
...	...	...	...
Analyzing this data involves understanding how soft drink preference varies with age.

Q6. Pearson correlation coefficient for sales calls vs sales made
Given data for 30 sales representatives:

Sales Rep	Sales Calls (per day)	Sales Made (per week)
1	20	5
2	15	4
...	...	...
Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the linear relationship between sales calls and sales made per week.
